00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.675
Hi everyone.

00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:09.362
My name is John Doe.

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:12.645
Welcome to my course, this will be an interesting one.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.645
I have been working with Java for more than 7 years.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:19.694
I love the language and teaching all I know about it.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:24.724
An important part of developing high-quality software is testing.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:29.026
As a developer, you are in charge of unit testing your code,

00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:33.419
and in Java, JUnit is the most popular framework for this task.

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:36.816
This course is designed for developers who are new to

00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:40.351
unit testing and want to learn JUnit 5,

00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:45.619
or already know JUnit 4 and want to learn about the features of the new version.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:48.455
Some of the major topics that we will cover include the new

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:52.475
architecture of JUnit 5 and the problem it solves,

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:56.930
how to use JUnit to create a static and dynamic test,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.390
how to extend JUnit with the new extension mechanism,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.950
and how to integrate JUnit with Gradle and Maven.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.530
By the end of this course,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.883
you'll understand how to use JUnit 5 to write unit tests.

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:15.568
Before beginning the course, you should have a basic knowledge of Java 8,

00:01:15.568 --> 00:01:19.394
streams, lambda expressions, and default methods in interfaces.
